Review the codebase and learn the standard coding conventions, design patterns, and overall architecture. Take note of the following:

- Tanstack Table implementation
- Use of hooks, modals, types.
- Drizzle as the database ORM, but using snake-case table naming instead of camelCase
- tRPC implementation
- Client state using Zustand

Once you've reviewed everything, create documentation in a new .md file under ai/ide with a summary of the codebase's architecture, framework, standard conventions used, implementation of the points made above, and other key learnings discovered during your audit of the codebase.

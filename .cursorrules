# Instructions

During you interaction with the user, if you find anything reusable in this project (e.g. version of a library, model name), especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received, you should take note in the `Lessons` section in the `scratchpad.md` file so you will not make the same mistake again. 

You should also create a new .md file under /ai/agent folder file as a scratchpad to organize your thoughts and create your plans. Especially when you receive a new task, you should first review the content of the scratchpad, first explain the task, and then plan the steps you need to take to complete the task. Only include steps that will complete the task effectively and accurately. You can use todo markers to indicate the progress, e.g.
[X] Task 1
[ ] Task 2

Also update the progress of the task in the Scratchpad when you finish a subtask.
Especially when you finished a milestone, it will help to improve your depth of task accomplishment to use the scratchpad to reflect and plan.
The goal is to help you maintain a big picture as well as the progress of the task. Always refer to the Scratchpad when you plan the next step.
